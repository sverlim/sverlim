Everything we do, we do only on behalf of the "АЛМАЗНЕ СВЕРДЛІННЯ™" service, a service for providing diamond drilling services in construction structures. Hereafter in the text - "SERVICE".
Each site, program, application, everything has a direct or indirect relationship with the service, carries both an open and hidden influence on the improvement of the service, or in some other way affects other tools of direct communication with the service.
We will try to attach an explanation to each project to understand what kind of idea was put into it, what was the algorithm of thoughts when the decision was made to start this or that direction. We are sure that many things will have all the signs of a separate independent type of activity, but believe everything only for the sake of service of a nationwide level.
